    "## Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear programming is an method used to solve linear minimization and maximation problems given a set of constraints and resource limitations. Although this approach is commonly used in mathematics, it is also broadly applicable to other industry verticals including business and economics as well as engineering and manufacturing. Consider a manufacturer who creates school supplies. They want to determine how many of notebook, pencils, and binders to produce. However, they have a limited set of raw materials and labor hours. How can they determine the optimal mix of products to minimize costs and maximize profit? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simplified example of a linear programming problem. Although these problems may vary in complexity, a standard linear programing problem consists of three components: <br>\n",
    "- Variables: *x =( x1,x2,...,xd)^T* <br>\n",
    "- Objective Function: *c·x* <br>\n",
    "- Constraints: *Ax ≤ b* (where A is a n×m matrix) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify and standardize linear programs, they are often expressed in a standard form where all constraints are inequalities. For example:\n",
    "- Maximize: *(c^T)x*\n",
    "- Subject to:\n",
    "    - *Ax <= b*\n",
    "    - *x >= 0*\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using this format, a linear program can then be represented in the form of a tuple *(A, b, c)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*[TBD -- add more to this section, probably]*\n",

    "There are multiple algorithms designed to solve linear programming problems including the ellipsoid algorithm and the interior-point methods. Although these algorithms both run in polynomial time, they can be complex and run slowly in practice. The approach analyzed in this report is the Simplex method. While the worst-case runtime complexity is exponential, it often runs quickly in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Simplex Algorithm\n",
    "The Simplex Algorithm, also referred to as the “Simplex Method” was invented by George Dantzig in 1947 (Carreira-Perpiñán). The Simplex Algorithm can be leveraged to solve linear programing problems and to identify the optimal solution from the set of all possible solutions. The Simplex Method follows an iterative approach. In each iteration, the problem is rewritten in an equivalent form. After a few iterations, the solution to the problem should be simpler to obtain. Essentially, the challenging linear program is iteratively rewritten until the optimal solution is easy to identify. \n",
